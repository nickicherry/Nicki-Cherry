    "Through pairing gestural fiberglass forms with found and fabricated objects, I create sculptures that blur distinctions between human, animal, plant, mineral, and other matter. They act as a conduit to navigate the enormous range of feelings our bodies bring about—failure, fragility, discomfort, emboldenment, awkwardness, and aspiration. My forms are made of pigmented fiberglass, cement, resin, and wax. Their surface detail mirrors how skin can externalize illness or emotional states—how acne can indicate hormonal imbalance or blushing can reveal embarrassment.  I use tubing, metal hardware, ceramics, flowers, and other objects to suggest circulation systems, growths, and prostheses."
