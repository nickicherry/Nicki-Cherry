    Nicki Cherry’s practice engages with what it means to be a body. Their sculptures are active sites of growth and decay—tulips bloom from soil-filled crevices, ceramic bodies leak milky fluids, spine-shaped candles burn and diffuse scent. These systems emulate human desire and failure to control our physical and psychic selves. By embracing the weird, awkward, and absurd realities of our corporeality, Cherry’s work invites an empathetic connection with its viewer.
