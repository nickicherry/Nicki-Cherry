    My sculptures are active sites of growth and decay—tulips bloom from stretching tendrils, ceramic bodies leak milky fluids, spine-shaped candles burn and diffuse scent. I build up bloated and monstrous figurative forms with pigmented concrete, fiberglass, wax, and resin. The attention to surface detail in my sculptures mirrors how the condition of human skin can externalize illness or emotional states. I punctuate these alien forms with recognizable objects: I place sculptures on medical stools, tether them to visible circulation systems, and adorn them with bandaids and back-braces.

    Although many people have experienced pain and anxiety in their lives, these conditions can feel incredibly isolating. By embracing the weird, awkward, and absurd as well as externalizing their physical and mental states, my sculptures invite a connection between themselves and the viewer. Through this bond, my work creates the potential for healing and kinship.
