    Nicki Cherry (b. 1992, West Lafayette, IN) is an artist working primarily in sculpture based in Queens, New York. Through a combination of bodily forms and found or fabricated objects, Cherry’s sculptures engage with the blurred spaces between organic and inorganic matter, and as well as physical and psychic selves. She aims for her work to act as a conduit to navigate the enormous range of feelings our bodies bring about—failure, fragility, discomfort, emboldenment, awkwardness, and aspiration. Each work begins with prompts or impulses: a sculpture with a circulation system, a prosthetic that is independent from its body, a hybrid between plant and animal. Her larger works—made of fiberglass, epoxy, cement, and wax—are characters who physically engage with the space and viewer through gesture.

    Cherry received her MFA from Yale School of Art in 2019 and her BA from The University of Chicago in 2014. She has exhibited her work nationally, including at Shin Gallery in New York; Icebox Project Space in Philadelphia; Archer Beach Haus, the Reva David Logan Center for the Arts, and Slate Arts and Performance in Chicago; and Green Gallery in New Haven.
