A ceramic tulip bulb, inspired by  Hieronymus Bosch's depiction of the stone of madness as a sprouting tulip in his painting "Cutting the Stone."

Made of a white clay body with black slip fired to cone 6. Reaction with the slip and clay body causes small blisters on the leaf. Tulips range in size from 4 to 6 inches tall.
