A ceramic tulip bulb, inspired by  Hieronymus Bosch's depiction of the stone of madness as a sprouting tulip in his painting "Cutting the Stone."

Made of a black clay body fired to cone 6. Reaction with the glaze and clay body causes blistering on the leaf. Tulips range in size from 4 to 6 inches tall.
